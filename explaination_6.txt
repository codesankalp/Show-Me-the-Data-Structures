#union
created a new list and append both values of linked list for union and then made a set of it.
and then returned this list of set of node values.
time complexity :- O(n)

#intersection
to get intersection, i created new list to get the values from the list of values of nodes of one linked list.
if both element are common then appended it and returned it
time complexity :- O(n)

I don't use deque as i only used append in this method.
