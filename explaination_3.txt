I followed the method given in the udacity and builded a tree using frequency of characters in data.
from the tree , if some character is repeating then I concatenate "1" with that and updated the value.
after this i get the different code for different character and I returned the encoded message.
worst time complexity for encoding is O(nlogn)


I reverse this step to get the decode message
worst time complexity for decoding is O(nlogn)
